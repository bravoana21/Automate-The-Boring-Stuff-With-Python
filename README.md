This is pretty much the beginning of my journey through Python! \
I tried to take note only of the essential information in the Jupyter Notebook. On the folders, you can find all the files made while reading the book and as assignments for each chapter. \
Hopefully, whoever gets to read this, finds it useful for their own journey. \
See you soon :)
